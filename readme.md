# ESP8266 LED Matrix Clock 🕰️

An animated LED matrix clock powered by the ESP8266! This project uses an ESP8266 module to display real-time data, including date and time, on a MAX7219 LED matrix. The clock syncs with the internet to fetch the accurate time and adjusts the brightness based on different times of the day.

## Features ✨

- **Time Sync via WiFi**: Connects to WiFi to fetch time data from Google’s server, ensuring accuracy.
- **LED Brightness Control**: Automatically adjusts brightness for night and day use.
- **Customizable Display**: Shows the date, time, and even a welcoming message on startup.
- **Smooth Animations**: Displays time in an animated style for a visually appealing experience.
- **Happy Face Icon** 😊: Includes a custom character array for displaying a happy face on the LED matrix.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Hardware Requirements

- **ESP8266 (NodeMCU 1.0)**
- **MAX7219 8x8 LED Matrix Display**
- **WiFi Connection** (to fetch real-time data)

### Circuit Connections

| ESP8266 Pin | LED Matrix Pin |
|-------------|----------------|
| D8 (GPIO15) | DIN            |
| D7 (GPIO13) | CS             |
| D6 (GPIO12) | CLK            |

### Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE** with the **ESP8266 Board Package** installed
- **MAX7219 Library** (for controlling the LED matrix)
- **ESP8266WiFi Library** (for WiFi connection)

## Installation 📦

1. **Clone this repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ESP8266_LED_Clock.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure the necessary libraries (`ESP8266WiFi.h` and `max7219.h`) are installed in your Arduino IDE.

3. **Edit Configuration**: Update your WiFi credentials and UTC offset in `ESP8266_Clock_Code.ino`:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid     = "YOUR_SSID";
   const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
   float utcOffset = 5.5; // Set to your timezone
   ```

4. **Upload Code**: Connect your ESP8266 to your computer, select the correct board and port, and upload `ESP8266_Clock_Code.ino`.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **WiFi Connection**: On startup, the clock attempts to connect to the WiFi network and syncs the time from Google’s server.
2. **Time and Animation**: Time is displayed with smooth animations, with the colon dots flashing every second.
3. **Brightness Control**: Adjusts LED intensity based on the time of day, with low brightness at night and higher brightness during daylight.

## Code Highlights 🖥️

- **Real-Time Data Fetching**:
  ```cpp
  getTime();
  ```
  Fetches current date and time from Google to keep the clock accurate.

- **Animation and Display**:
  ```cpp
  showAnimClock();
  ```
  Handles animations for clock transitions and displays updated time.

- **Dynamic Brightness**:
  ```cpp
  if ( (h == 0) || ((h >= 1) && (h <= 6)) ) sendCmdAll(CMD_INTENSITY, 0);
  else sendCmdAll(CMD_INTENSITY, 10);
  ```
  Automatically adjusts LED intensity based on the current hour.
